## Welcome!

ActionAllegro is a quick GUI application built in rust that allows you to run and organize Github Workflows directly from within. It's an app born from lack of features on the Github Side. The main problem I was presented with was no options to organize workflows after a repository gained a large number of them. Sorting through them on the Github side was rather difficult. So this app takes an approach to workflows that allows you to add them into nice organized folders. Other than that, it allows you to pull down a repo, and push it up after displaying the changes to it. You can also run and view workflows regardless of the type they are right from the app.

## Features

## Installation

There really isn't an installation honestly. [Click here](https://github.com/Lynxx-Networks/ActionAllegro/releases), download the latest release, and run the app. Piece of cake.
